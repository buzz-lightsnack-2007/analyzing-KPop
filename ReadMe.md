# analyzing-KPop
K-pop is growing popularity, and there's no sign of stopping. With this, let's find out its various trends! 

## Scope
This program analyzes trends within **K-Pop idols, groups, and music videos from 1992 to 2020.**

There is no updated data that is easily available as CSV, so this script uses the data provided from [DBKPop's database](https://dbkpop.com/) as of 2020, wherein the CSV version is available at [Kim Ji Hoo's Kaggle entry](https://tiny.one/mumr4cph).
